# 🔒 Security Policy

Security is a top priority for the Pearlen Language project.
This document outlines the supported versions and how to report vulnerabilities safely and responsibly.

## ✅ Supported Versions

Only specific releases receive security updates.
Please ensure you are using a supported version for the latest patches and fixes.

| **< 0.1** | ❌ No              |

If you're on an unsupported version, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest stable release.
