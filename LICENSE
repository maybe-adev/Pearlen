A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Pearlen was created in 2025 by Ayush Baral as an educational programming
language designed to teach teens and school kids the basics of coding
through a simple, approachable syntax.

Pearlen draws inspiration from Python's readability and simplicity, while
providing a small, easy-to-learn core that includes variables, arithmetic,
if-else statements, loops, and print functionality.

Many examples and tutorials included with Pearlen are freely available and
dual-licensed under MIT and Apache 2.0 for maximum flexibility.
